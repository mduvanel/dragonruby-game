# Concepts
- starts as an escape game from a room, Zelda-like without combat, puzzle-oriented
- Single action button on top of direction keys
- idea is to have a simple, self-contained scenario until the escape from the room
- possibility to extend scenario and character(s) beyond this first escape game
- survival, food-based progression, based on capacity to find/produce food
- hero has a health bar that gets slowly drained whenever he moves/acts or over time
- when the bar reaches 0, he has to go back to his jerrican to drink a preparation that feeds him a little.
- the drink gives him back a bit of his health bar, but he is back to its original position in the room.
- food can restore parts of his health bar
- a glass allows him to fill the glass at the jerrican to increase its movement capacity. Later, bottles can be filled too.
- whenever the player has at least one element in his inventory that can restore health, it will be consumed automatically when the bar reaches 0.
- bar can grow in size to increase radius too. Some other items may affect the bar : slower decline, special abilities when bar is above a certain level.

## Scenario
This game, although purely inside a room in the first scene, takes place in a cli-fi, dystopian world.

At the beginning the hero has fuzzy memories and has a very limited range of operation, because he suffers from malnutrition.

The beginning focuses on understanding how the health bar works and how its level affects capacities, how it can be re-filled and what happens when it becomes empty.

Over time when hero reaches higher level of health bar, memories start coming back and he is more clear about what happened, and what he wants to do.


## First scene
- hero wakes up in a room, hungry.
- sees something shining on the table, player has to move up to it and hit action button.
- if player fails to reach and health bar goes to 0, control is lost and player rushes back to the jerrican to restore health.
- when shiny food is acted upon, player tries to eat and gains some energy that goes above the original level. Hero feels better and walk speed increases when above some level.
